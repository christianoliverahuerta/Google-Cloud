### Compute Engine: Qwik Start - Windows # GSP093

Compute engine lets create and run VMs on Google infrastructure. 
We can run Windows apps on Compute Engine.
In this lab, I learn how to launch a Windows Server instance in CE and use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to it.

## Create a VM instance
  Compute engine > VM instances > Create instances 
    Name: gcelab
    Region
    Zone
    Series: E2
    Boot disk > Change 
      Operating system: Windows
      Version: Windows Server 2022 Datacenter
  > Create

## Remote Desktop (RDP) into Windows Server
  1. To see whether the server instance is ready for an RDP connection, run the following command at your Cloud Shell terminal command line:
    gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output instance-1
  2. To set a password for logging into the RDP, run the following command in Cloud Shell.
  Be sure you replace [instance] with the VM Instance that you created, [zone] that you defined earlier and set [username] as admin.
    gcloud compute reset-windows-password [instance] --zone [zone] --user [username]
    > Y 
  3. Connect to server
  4. Once launched, the Spark View (RDP) window opens. Use your Windows username admin and password you previously recorded in Step 2.
  5. Add VM instance's External IP as your Domain. Click Connect to confirm you want to connect.
